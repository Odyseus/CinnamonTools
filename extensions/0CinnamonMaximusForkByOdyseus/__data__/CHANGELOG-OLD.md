```
Cinnamon Maximus (Fork by Odyseus) extension
- Better handling of **Settings.BindingDirection**. Just to avoid surprises when that constant is
removed on future versions of Cinnamon.
- Added option to handle invisible windows problem. On the original Maximus extension (by fmete) I
changed one of the _MOTIF_WM_HINTS flags from 0x2 to 0x0 to avoid having a border at the top of a
maximized window with its title bar removed. This was working perfectly fine until Cinnamon 3.4. On
Cinnamon 3.4, setting that flag to 0x0 would result on windows that started maximized and with their
title bars removed to become invisible. I simply added an option for people using Cinnamon 3.4 or
greater to change that flag.

ago. LOL
