Multi Translator extension - Fixed selection of text when the translation dialog is opened and there
is text in the source text entry. And since I was here, I added an option to choose to select all
text or not on the source entry on translation dialog open
- Fixed transparent background on language chooser dialogs using the default theme (extension dialog
theme)
- Uglified/un-minified/expanded some of the SVG files for easier review
- Removed *pref-* prefixes from all preference names. This made sense when the extension used
Cinnamon's native system
- Renamed schema file to use the extension UUID
- Some other minor corrections
- Added option to remove the settings schema to the settings.py file
- Expanded the help file with information about the settings window.

Multi Translator extension
**Completely remove any previous version of this extension before installing the new version.**

- Twelfth and last prototype.
- Changed the function to get selection from synchronous to asynchronous.
- Enable the use of markup on the history window so the styling tags, if any, aren't displayed.
- Changed the use of **set_width/set_height** method to the use of **set_size** method. Curiously,
this fixes some issues on Cinnamon 2.8.x.
- Some code clean up.
- Tested compatibility with several Cinnamon themes. See **Known issues**.
- Further tests on all supported Cinnamon versions (2.8, 3.0.x and 3.2.x).

Multi Translator extension
**Completely remove any previous version of this extension before installing the new version.**

- Eleventh prototype.
- Changed from individual buttons to a menu button on the preferences window to manage settings.
- Some grammatical corrections.
- Preliminary tests on Cinnamon 2.8. Everything seemed OK at first, but the elements inside the
translation dialog were invisible. After a couple of tweaks to add retro-compatibility, everything
seems to work as it should.

Multi Translator extension
**Completely remove any previous version of this extension before installing the new version.**

- Tenth prototype changelog
- Finally fixed text alignment on the translation dialog top bar.
- Removed some leftovers from the past usage of Cinnamon's native settings system.
- Removed some more leftovers from the past usage of Gnome-shell's APIs.
- Finally managed to align the Quit/Help/Main menu buttons to the top-right corner of the
translation dialog.
- Changed the way all internal imports are made.
- Now both popups inside the translation dialog (from the provider selector and the main menu)
behave as they should.
    - Both popups will close when their respective buttons are pressed for a second time.
- When the language choosers dialogs or the quick help dialog are opened, any opened popup will
close automatically.
    - When the translation dialog is closed, no popup will stay open on screen.
- Now keybindings are updated correctly after changing any of them.
- Some tweaks and fixes to the theme's style sheets.
- Added icons to the translation providers popup.
- Added a missing translatable string.
- Preliminary tests on Cinnamon 3.2. All seems OK so far.

Multi Translator extension - Sixth prototype
- Fixed style sheet unloading after switching a desktop theme
- Translation history fully implemented
- Added Yandex API key configuration and randomization of its usage
- Better error reporting of Yandex usage
- Added Bing and Apertium providers (dependent on translate-shell)
- Created localization template (**Do not start translations just yet**). I created it mainly to
test the sorting of translated language names (BTW, the list of languages can be translated and
sorted alphabetically and it works beautifully)
- Cleaned some unused code.

```
Multi Translator extension - Fifth prototype
- Some minor fixes on the themes' style sheets
- Fixed a bug introduced by the implementation of "Detect language" as source language.     - With
Yandex as service provider, the target language chooser was empty.     - With Google as service
provider, the argument "auto" was passed to the **trans** script and interpreted as a text to be
translated. That's why all translations showed the word *auto* (car) in the translation result. LOL
- First step on implementing translation history. It can be opened but the extension still doesn't
save the translation results to it
- Implemented a menu on the translator dialog that will allow me to add more direct access to
certain settings without adding to much clutter
- Updated the list of supported languages.
