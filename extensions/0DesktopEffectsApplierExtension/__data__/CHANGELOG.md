Initial commit. An extension that allows to apply effects to windows or the screen. It has the ability to apply effects as simple as brightness, desaturation, contrast and colors and as complex as OpenGL shaders.

TODO:

- Complete Spanish localization.
- Complete help page.
- Complete contributors section.
- Implement a wizard-like mechanism to apply effects. This extension works exclusively with keyboard shortcuts and can be configured with hundreds of effects. No one (including me) will ever bother to configure and remember hundreds of keyboard shortcuts!

```
