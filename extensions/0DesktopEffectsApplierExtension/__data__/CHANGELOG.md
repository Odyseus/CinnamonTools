```
- Corrected all the shader files. It seems that the shader language is susceptible to certain combination of software versions and/or hardware.
- Removed the redundant declaration of the XletMeta variable in extension.js.
- Moved the addition of the Help button for the desktop notification when the notification is created, not updated.

```
Initial commit. An extension that allows to apply effects to windows or the screen. It has the ability to apply effects as simple as brightness, desaturation, contrast and colors and as complex as OpenGL shaders.

TODO:

- Complete Spanish localization.
- Complete help page.
- Complete contributors section.
- Implement a wizard-like mechanism to apply effects. This extension works exclusively with keyboard shortcuts and can be configured with hundreds of effects. No one (including me) will ever bother to configure and remember hundreds of keyboard shortcuts!

```
