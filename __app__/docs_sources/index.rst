    :title: About this documentation

    Here is documented the usage of the Cinnamon Tools' Python application ``app.py``. This Python application is used to build all xlets/themes into their final usable state and to assist in the development of the xlets/themes themselves.

    :title: End users

    End users can focus their attention on :ref:`how to build xlets <how-to-build-xlets-reference>` and :ref:`how to build themes <how-to-build-themes-reference>` sections.

.. note::

    Technically, the generic term **xlet** applies to Cinnamon applets, extensions, desklets and themes. But I will be using throughout this documentation the explicit term **theme** for themes and **xlet** for the rest of xlets.
