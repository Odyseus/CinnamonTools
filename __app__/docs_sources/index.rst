Cinnamon Tools' development documentation
#########################################

A collection of xlets for the Cinnamon Desktop Environment.

.. important::

    The use of this Python application is merely to assist in the development of the xlets in this repository (creating this documentation, creating the xlet's localized help pages, updating the xlet's POT files, etc.). It is also used to *build* the xlets into their final usable state.

.. important::

    All xlets in the repository aren't directly usable, they need to be *built*. *Building* an xlet just means that the *raw xlet* (as found in the repository) will be copied into another location (chosen when performing the building) and a string substitution will be done that will apply a generated UUID (<xlet_name>@<custom_domain_name>) to all files (files content and file names). It will also compile the ``gsettings`` files (if an xlet contains such files) and copy files common to all xlets (LICENSE.md, localizations installer script, etc.).

    The same principle applies to the themes in this repository (they need to be *built*). Although, the process is totally different.

.. important::

    Technically, the generic term **xlet** applies to applets, extensions, desklets and themes. But I will be using the explicit term **theme** for themes and **xlet** for the rest of xlets.
