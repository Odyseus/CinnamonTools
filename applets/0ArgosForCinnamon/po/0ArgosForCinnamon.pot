msgid "Argos for Cinnamon is an applet that turns executables' standard output into panel dropdown menus. It is inspired by, and fully compatible with, the Gnome Shell extension called [Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos) by [Philipp Emanuel Weidmann](https://github.com/p-e-w), which in turn is inspired by, and fully compatible with, the [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) application for macOS. Argos for Cinnamon supports many [BitBar plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins) without modifications, giving you access to a large library of well-tested scripts in addition to being able to write your own."
