- Added an extra search option. Now the search can be configured to search only on application names

issue. Plus, it isn't as useless as the default search method.

```
Custom Cinnamon Menu applet
- Reverted back a change in the method to clear an array. I switched to the method of setting an
array length to zero instead of re-declaring an empty array. But this had pernicious side effects,
like breaking fuzzy search. Lets stick to what it works.

Custom Cinnamon Menu applet
- Changed *multiversion* implementation. Created symlinks inside the version folder so I don't keep
forgetting to copy the files from the root folder. The only *unique* file, and the only reason that
I use *multiversion*, is the settings-schema.json file.
