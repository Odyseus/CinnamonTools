```
Fork of [Desktop Capture](https://github.com/rjanja/desktop-capture) applet by Rob Adams (a.k.a. rjanja).

- Initial fork version.
- Principal differences with the original applet:
    - More convenient handling of settings. Most settings can be changed directly from the applet menu or its context menu without the need to constantly open the applet settings window.
    - Keyboard shortcuts are not only available for Cinnamon's built-in features, but for all screenshot/screencast programs.
    - Settings are immediately available after changed without the need to restart Cinnamon.
    - The 'Repeat last' item isn't only available for Cinnamon's screenshots, but for any device and any program.
- TODOs:
    - Decide if I should add back the notification and upload services mechanisms.
    - Decide if I should implement a history mechanism.
    - Check if the HELP.html page content is complete.
    - Finish Spanish localization.

```
