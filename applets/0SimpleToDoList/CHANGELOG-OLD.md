```
Simple ToDo List applet
- Removed character limit from the **New task...** entry and added text wrapping and multilines
capabilities to it. Closes #124
- Improved the display of the tasks counter on the applet label. As it was (showing only the total
amount of tasks), wasn't very useful. Now it displays the amount of completed tasks and the total
amount of tasks. Closes #123
- Added tooltip to the applet.
