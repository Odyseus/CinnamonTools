- The icons used are from [Weather Icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons).
- Icons licensed under [SIL OFL 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
- All icons are mostly untouched, except for the following modifications:
    - All icons were *re-fitted* (the actual images were expanded so they occupy the entire document).
    - On the icons with lighting bolts touching the clouds, the lighting bolts were separated from the clouds.
    - No other changes were made because I simply suck at editing SVG files (LOL).
